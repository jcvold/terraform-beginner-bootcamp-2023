    <h1>Boardgames!</h1>
    <h2>(not video games)</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time in the land of Clueful Chess-opoly, players rolled dice made of laughter and moved their pieces, which were sentient marshmallows with top hats. 
        The goal was to collect rainbow-colored houses made of cotton candy while avoiding the dreaded "Giggle-Goop" squares that turned your pawns into singing pineapples. 
        The game's narrator was a quacking rubber duck named Sir Quacks-a-lot, who imparted wisdom in the form of interpretive dance.</p>

    <p>Players could also summon flying pancakes to disrupt their opponents, creating a delightful frenzy of syrupy chaos. 
        The winner was crowned the Grand Fluffinator of Fanciful Frolics and got to wear the prestigious Sock-of-Silly Supremacy for a week. 
        The end, or maybe just the beginning of the jello-filled jamboree!</p>
